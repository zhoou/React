I am very happy if this projects can help you . If you are interested, you can clone or download it.

after you download , you should do it first if you have not install the `webpack` in global :
```sh
npm install webpack -g
```
then , begin to initialize the project : 
```sh
npm install
```
Finally , run it :
```sh 
webpack -p
```

Begin to initialize the plugins the project need:

Final , Open the html

open /Build/View/Index.html to browser
