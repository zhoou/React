`Primary Edition`  

I am very happy if this projects can help you . If you are interested, you can clone or download it.

after you download , you should do it first if you have not install the `webpack` in global :
```sh
npm install webpack -g
```
then , begin to initialize the project : 
```sh
npm install
```
Finally , run it :
```sh 
webpack -p
```
